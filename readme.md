# Generating Efficient Frontier of Assets

## Part - a

Following three ETFs (exchange-traded funds) were used to form a portfolio of three assets. An ETF operates just like a stock, but these assets represent market indices or broad set of securities (stocks or bonds). For example, the purchase of one share of SPY (see below for description) represents an investment into the 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

(1)	SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), this is a fund that mimics the performance of the S&P 500 which is a well known market index consisting of 500 large capitalization stocks from the U.S.

(2)	iShares Core US Treasury Bond (GOVT), this is a fund that mimics the performance of a wide set of U.S Treasury bonds.

(3)	iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Mini Vol (EEMV), this is fund that mimics the performance of emerging market stocks but with lower volatility compared to other emerging market funds.

yahoo (e.g. yahoo.com or yahoo.ca) finance was used to get the monthly adjusted closing prices of SPY, GOVT, and EEMV from Jan 2014 to Oct 2019 and mean-variance optimization model was used to generate the efficient frontier

## Part - b

Efficient frontier was constructed for the stocks SPY, GOV, EEMV as well as the stocks below (so portfolios will have 8 assets now) that have heavy involvement and connection to development or use of blockchain technology (some people think that these stocks are going to do well in the future)
 
(4)	CME Group (CME)

(5)	Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)

(6)	Cboe Global Markets (CBOE)

(7)	Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)

(8)	Accenture (ACN)



Finally, the efficient frontiers from Part (a) and Part (b) was compared
